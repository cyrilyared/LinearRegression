# Linear Regression

Uses linear regression (batch gradient descent) to find the linear relationship between a specified number of features and the target variable.

The user can specify the number of parameters, the size of the training set, the learning rate, the minimum precision required for convergence and the maximum number of epochs. 

The relationship generated is based on if either the model has converged or if the maximum number of epochs has been reached.

* **LinearRegression** Class: Uses linear regression to find the relationship between the features and the target variable.
* **RowData** Class: Provides a framework for obtaining and storing the training data for each feature and the target variable.
